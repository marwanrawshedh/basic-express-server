## on lab 401-02 i built the structure as that written in the lab guideline 
## I installed all the dependencies(dotenv ,express,jest,supertest)
## after that I built the server from scratch and I made the index.js as a starting point 
## after that I built the test files server, logger. validator, as it is required, Assert the following
- 404 on a bad route
- 404 on a bad method
- 500 if no name in the query string
- 200 if the name is in the query string
- given an name in the query string, the output object is correct 
## so then I wrote the routes that required, consisting "/person route "
## before the deployment I tested my code and everything went fine.

## finally I did ACP and merged the branch the main branch.
